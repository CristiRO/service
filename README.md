# Prerequisites

For using Github Codespaces, no prerequisites are mandatory.
Follow the [./PREREQUISITES.md](./PREREQUISITES.md) instructions to configure a local virtual machine with Ubuntu, Docker, IntelliJ.

# Access the code

* Fork the code GitHub repository under your Organization
  * https://github.com/UNIBUC-PROD-ENGINEERING/service
* Clone the code repository:
  * git@github.com:YOUR_ORG_NAME/service.git

# Run code in Github Codespaces

* Make sure that the Github repository is forked under your account / Organization
* Create a new Codespace from your forked repository
* Wait for the Codespace to be up and running
* Make sure that Docker service has been started
    * ```docker ps``` should return no error
* For running all services in docker:
    * Build the docker image of the prod-eng service
        * ```make build```
    * Start all the service containers
        * ```./start.sh```
* For running / debugging directly in Visual Studio Code
  * Build and run the Spring Boot service
    * ```./gradlew build```
    * ```./gradlew bootRun```
  * Start the MongoDB related services
      * ```./start_mongo_only.sh```
* Use [requests.http](requests.http) to test API endpoints
* Navigation between methods (e.g. 'Go to Definition') may require:
  * ```./gradlew build```

# Run/debug code in IntelliJ
* Build the code
    * IntelliJ will build it automatically
    * If you want to build it from command line and also run unit tests, run: ```./gradlew build```
* Create an IntelliJ run configuration for a Jar application
    * Add in the configuration the JAR path to the build folder `./build/libs/prod-eng-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* Start the MongoDB container using docker compose
    * ```docker-compose up -d mongo```
* Run/debug your IntelliJ run configuration
* Open in your browser:
    * http://localhost:8080/users

# Deploy and run the code locally as docker instance

* Build the docker image of the prod-eng service
    * ```make build```
* Start all the containers
    * ```./start.sh```

* Verify that all containers started, by running
  ```
  service git:(master) ✗  $ docker ps

  ```
* Open in your browser:
    * http://localhost:8080/users
* You can test other API endpoints using [requests.http](requests.http)
* You can access the MongoDB Admin UI at:
  * http://localhost:8090
  * default credentials: username `unibuc`, password `adobe`
  * database `test` contains application entities
